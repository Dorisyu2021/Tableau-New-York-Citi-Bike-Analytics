# Tableau New York Citi Bike Analytics

Please find my charts here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yang.yu5072
It looks like this:




The task is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena. Based on the questions we want to explore, there could be plenty of different maps and charts.

For this presentation, I made two unions, the third quarter and the fourth quarter.

1.I made visualizations individually for July-Sep Top Start Station and End Station followed with Oct-Dec's visualizations, not only I can compare with the same period, same comparison for different period works too. In same period, top stations are very similar.

2.I drew lines between the start point and end point on map for this two period with the % of each station's count in total. I can easily see which station is much busier than others. City bikes enhances the connection between Jersey and Manhattan area.

3.I compared the avg duration for each station in those two period, apprently people will reduce the usage duration in winter, but the increasing number of enrollment will need more data to explain this phenomenon.

4.For my story, core is comparison.

For each dashboard, I fail to add actions with filter opinion by "select" due to my own laptop technical problem, which is a pity.
